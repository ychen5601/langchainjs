# Cookbook

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Example code for accomplishing common tasks with the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). These examples show how to compose different Runnable (the core LCEL interface) components to achieve various tasks. If you're just getting acquainted with LCEL, the [Prompt + LLM](/docs/expression_language/cookbook/prompt_llm_parser) page is a good place to start.

Several pages in this section include embedded interactive screencasts from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).
They're a great resource for getting started - you can edit the included code whenever you want, just as if you were pair programming with a teacher!
