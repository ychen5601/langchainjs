# Use RunnableMaps

RunnableMaps allow you to execute multiple Runnables in parallel, and to return the output of these Runnables as a map.

## Manipulating outputs/inputs

Maps can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence.

Note below that the object within the `RunnableSequence.from()` call is automatically coerced into a runnable map. All keys of the object must
have values that are runnables or can be themselves coerced to runnables (functions to `RunnableLambda`s or objects to `RunnableMap`s).
This coercion will also occur when composing chains via the `.pipe()` method.

Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys "context" and "question". The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the "question" key.
