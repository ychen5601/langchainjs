# Neo4j

## Setup

Install the dependencies needed for Neo4j:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install neo4j-driver
```

## Usage

This walkthrough uses Neo4j to demonstrate a graph database integration.

### Instantiate a graph and retrieve information the the graph by generating Cypher query language statements using GraphCypherQAChain.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import GraphDBExample from "@examples/chains/graph_db_neo4j.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{GraphDBExample}</CodeBlock>

# Disclaimer ⚠️

_Security note_: Make sure that the database connection uses credentials
that are narrowly-scoped to only include necessary permissions.
Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling
code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation
of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such
data is present in the database.
The best way to guard against such negative outcomes is to (as appropriate)
limit the permissions granted to the credentials used with this tool.
For example, creating read only users for the database is a good way to
ensure that the calling code cannot mutate or delete data.
See the [security page](/docs/security) for more information.
