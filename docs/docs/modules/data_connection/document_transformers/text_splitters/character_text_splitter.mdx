# Split by character

This is the simplest method. This splits based on characters (by default "\n\n") and measure chunk length by number of characters.

1. How the text is split: by single character
2. How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters

# CharacterTextSplitter

Besides the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, there is also the more standard `CharacterTextSplitter`. This splits only on one type of character (defaults to `"\n\n"`). You can use it in the exact same way.

```typescript
import { Document } from "langchain/document";
import { CharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";

const text = "foo bar baz 123";
const splitter = new CharacterTextSplitter({
  separator: " ",
  chunkSize: 7,
  chunkOverlap: 3,
});
const output = await splitter.createDocuments([text]);
```
