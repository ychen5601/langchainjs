# Entity memory

Entity Memory remembers given facts about specific entities in a conversation. It extracts information on entities (using an LLM) and builds up its knowledge about that entity over time (also using an LLM).

Let's first walk through using this functionality.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

import Example from "@examples/memory/entity.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

### Inspecting the Memory Store

You can also inspect the memory store directly to see the current summary of each entity:

import MemoryInspectionExample from "@examples/memory/entity_memory_inspection.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{MemoryInspectionExample}</CodeBlock>
