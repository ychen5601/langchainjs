# Dynamically selecting from multiple retrievers

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `RouterChain` paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects which Retrieval system to use. Specifically we show how to use the `MultiRetrievalQAChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the retrieval QA chain which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using it.
