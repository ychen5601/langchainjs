# Retrieval QA

This example showcases question answering over an index.

import RetrievalQARunnableExample from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa.ts";
import RetrievalQAExampleCustom from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa_custom.ts";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

The following examples combing a `Retriever` (in this case a vector store) with a question answering chain to do question answering.

## Usage

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever`, along with a `RunnableSequence` to do question answering.
We create a `ChatPromptTemplate` which contains our base system prompt and an input variable for the `question`.

## Custom `QA` chain

In the below example, we are using a `VectorStore` as the `Retriever` and implementing a similar flow to the `MapReduceDocumentsChain` chain.
In this example we're querying relevant documents based on the query, and from those documents we use an LLM to parse out only the relevant information.
Once all the relevant information is gathered we pass it once more to an LLM to generate the answer.

In the example below we instantiate our `Retriever` and query the relevant documents based on the query. We then use those returned relevant documents to
pass as context to the `loadQAMapReduceChain`. This function loads the `MapReduceDocumentsChain` and passes the relevant documents as context to the chain
after mapping over all to reduce to just the necessary context.

import RetrievalQARunnableExampleSources from "@examples/chains/retrieval_qa_sources.ts";

## Return Source Documents

Additionally, we can create a custom function which returns the documents used as context when querying the LLM.
