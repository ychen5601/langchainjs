# Sequential

The next step after calling a language model is make a series of calls to a language model. This is particularly useful when you want to take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.

In this notebook we will walk through some examples for how to do this, using sequential chains. Sequential chains allow you to connect multiple chains and compose them into pipelines that execute some specific scenario. There are two types of sequential chains:

- `SimpleSequentialChain`: The simplest form of sequential chains, where each step has a singular input/output, and the output of one step is the input to the next.
- `SequentialChain`: A more general form of sequential chains, allowing for multiple inputs/outputs.

## `SimpleSequentialChain`

Let's start with the simplest possible case which is `SimpleSequentialChain`.

An `SimpleSequentialChain` is a chain that allows you to join multiple single-input/single-output chains into one chain.

The example below shows a sample usecase. In the first step, given a title, a synopsis of a play is generated. In the second step, based on the generated synopsis, a review of the play is generated.

## `SequentialChain`

More advanced scenario useful when you have multiple chains that have more than one input or ouput keys.

Unlike for `SimpleSequentialChain`, outputs from all previous chains will be available to the next chain.
