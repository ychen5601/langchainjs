# Output parsers

Language models output text. But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.

Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:

- "Get format instructions": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.
- "Parse": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.

And then one optional one:

- "Parse with prompt": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.

## Get started

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Below we go over one useful type of output parser, the `StructuredOutputParser`.

## Structured Output Parser

This output parser can be used when you want to return multiple fields. If you want complex schema returned (i.e. a JSON object with arrays of strings), use the Zod Schema detailed below.

import Structured from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser_sequence.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Structured}</CodeBlock>

## Structured Output Parser with Zod Schema

This output parser can be also be used when you want to define the output schema using Zod, a TypeScript validation library. The Zod schema passed in needs be parseable from a JSON string, so eg. `z.date()` is not allowed.

import StructuredZod from "@examples/prompts/structured_parser_zod_sequence.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StructuredZod}</CodeBlock>
