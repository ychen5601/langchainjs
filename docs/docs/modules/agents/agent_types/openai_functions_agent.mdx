# OpenAI functions

Certain OpenAI models (like `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`) have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should to be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function.
In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions.
The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API.

The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/agents/openai.ts";
import CustomPromptExample from "@examples/agents/openai_custom_prompt.ts";
import RunnableExample from "@examples/agents/openai_runnable.ts";

:::tip Compatibility
Must be used with an [OpenAI Functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) model.

# With LCEL

In this example we'll use LCEL to construct a highly customizable agent that is given two tools: search and calculator.
We'll then pull in a prompt template from the [LangChainHub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) and pass that to our runnable agent.
Lastly we'll use the default OpenAI functions output parser `OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser`.
This output parser contains a method `parseAIMessage` which when provided with a message, either returns an instance of `FunctionsAgentAction` if there is another action to be taken my the agent, or `AgentFinish` if the agent has completed its objective.

## Adding memory

We can also use memory to save our previous agent input/outputs, and pass it through to each agent iteration.
Using memory can help give the agent better context on past interactions, which can lead to more accurate responses beyond what the `agent_scratchpad` can do.

Adding memory only requires a few changes to the above example.

First, import and instantiate your memory class, in this example we'll use `BufferMemory`.

```typescript
import { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
```

```typescript
const memory = new BufferMemory({
  memoryKey: "history", // The object key to store the memory under
  inputKey: "question", // The object key for the input
  outputKey: "answer", // The object key for the output
  returnMessages: true,
});
```

Then, update your prompt to include another `MessagesPlaceholder`. This time we'll be passing in the `chat_history` variable from memory.

```typescript
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["ai", "You are a helpful assistant"],
  ["human", "{input}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("agent_scratchpad"),
  new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
]);
```

Next, inside your `RunnableSequence` add a field for loading the `chat_history` from memory.

```typescript
const runnableAgent = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    input: (i: { input: string; steps: AgentStep[] }) => i.input,
    agent_scratchpad: (i: { input: string; steps: AgentStep[] }) =>
      formatAgentSteps(i.steps),
    // Load memory here
    chat_history: async (_: { input: string; steps: AgentStep[] }) => {
      const { history } = await memory.loadMemoryVariables({});
      return history;
    },
  },
  prompt,
  modelWithTools,
  new OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser(),
]);
```

Finally we can call the agent, and save the output after the response is returned.

```typescript
const query = "What is the weather in New York?";
console.log(`Calling agent executor with query: ${query}`);
const result = await executor.call({
  input: query,
});
console.log(result);
/*
Calling agent executor with query: What is the weather in New York?
{
  output: 'The current weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The humidity is at 54% and the wind is blowing at 6 mph. There is 0% chance of precipitation.'
}
*/

// Save the result and initial input to memory
await memory.saveContext(
  {
    question: query,
  },
  {
    answer: result.output,
  }
);

const query2 = "Do I need a jacket?";
const result2 = await executor.call({
  input: query2,
});
console.log(result2);
/*
{
  output: 'Based on the current weather in New York, you may not need a jacket. However, if you feel cold easily or will be outside for a long time, you might want to bring a light jacket just in case.'
}
 */
```

You may also inspect the LangSmith traces for both agent calls here:

- [Question 2](https://smith.langchain.com/public/2052d0d1-5640-44bc-9024-d443d46db2a4/r)

# With `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions`

This agent also supports `StructuredTool`s with more complex input schemas.

## Prompt customization

You can pass in a custom string to be used as the system message of the prompt as follows:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{CustomPromptExample}</CodeBlock>
