### Azure OpenAI

> [Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure), often referred to as `Azure` is a cloud computing platform run by `Microsoft`, which offers access, management, and development of applications and services through global data centers. It provides a range of capabilities, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). `Microsoft Azure` supports many programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

> [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) is an `Azure` service with powerful language models from `OpenAI` including the `GPT-3`, `Codex` and `Embeddings model` series for content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.

Set the environment variables to get access to the `Azure OpenAI` service.

Inside an environment variables file (`.env`).

```shell
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="YOUR-BASE-URL"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME="YOUR-INSTANCE-NAME"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-NAME"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="YOUR-EMBEDDINGS-NAME"
```

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/llms/azure).

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
```

## Text Embedding Models

### Azure OpenAI

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/azure_openai)

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";
```

```typescript
const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  azureOpenAIApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "YOUR-API-VERSION", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
  azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "{MY_INSTANCE_NAME}", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
});
```

## Chat Models

### Azure OpenAI

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/chat/azure)

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
```

```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  temperature: 0.9,
  azureOpenAIApiKey: "SOME_SECRET_VALUE", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "YOUR-API-VERSION", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
  azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: "{MY_INSTANCE_NAME}", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: "{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}", // In Node.js defaults to process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
});
```

### Azure Blob Storage

> [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

> [Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) offers fully managed
> file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (`SMB`) protocol,
> Network File System (`NFS`) protocol, and `Azure Files REST API`. `Azure Files` are based on the `Azure Blob Storage`.

`Azure Blob Storage` is designed for:

- Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
- Storing files for distributed access.
- Streaming video and audio.
- Writing to log files.
- Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
- Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @azure/storage-blob
```

See a [usage example for the Azure Blob Storage](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/azure_blob_storage_container).

```typescript
import { AzureBlobStorageContainerLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/azure_blob_storage_container";
```

See a [usage example for the Azure Files](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/azure_blob_storage_file).

```typescript
import { AzureBlobStorageFileLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/web/azure_blob_storage_file";
```
