## Vector Store

### Vertex AI Vector Search

> [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview),
> formerly known as Vertex AI Matching Engine, provides the industry's leading high-scale
> low latency vector database. These vector databases are commonly
> referred to as vector similarity-matching or an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) service.

```typescript
import { MatchingEngine } from "langchain/vectorstores/googlevertexai";
```

## Tools

### Google Search

- Set up a Custom Search Engine, following [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)
- Get an API Key and Custom Search Engine ID from the previous step, and set them as environment variables `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` respectively

There exists a `GoogleCustomSearch` utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```typescript
import { GoogleCustomSearch } from "langchain/tools";
```

We can easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent). We can do this with:

```typescript
const tools = [new GoogleCustomSearch({})];
// Pass this variable into your agent.
```
