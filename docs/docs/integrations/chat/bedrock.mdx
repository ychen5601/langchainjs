# BedrockChat

> [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that makes Foundation Models (FMs)
> from leading AI startups and Amazon available via an API. You can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for your use case.

## Setup

You'll need to install a few official AWS packages as peer dependencies:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-crypto/sha256-js @aws-sdk/credential-provider-node @smithy/protocol-http @smithy/signature-v4 @smithy/eventstream-codec @smithy/util-utf8 @aws-sdk/types
```

You can also use BedrockChat in web environments such as Edge functions or Cloudflare Workers by omitting the `@aws-sdk/credential-provider-node` dependency
and using the `web` entrypoint:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aws-crypto/sha256-js @smithy/protocol-http @smithy/signature-v4 @smithy/eventstream-codec @smithy/util-utf8 @aws-sdk/types
```

## Usage

Currently, only Anthropic and Cohere models are supported with the chat model integration. For foundation models from AI21 or Amazon, see [the text generation Bedrock variant](/docs/integrations/llms/bedrock).
