# ChatOpenAI

You can use OpenAI's chat models as follows:

import OpenAI from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAI}</CodeBlock>

If you're part of an organization, you can set `process.env.OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` with your OpenAI organization id, or pass it in as `organization` when
initializing the model.

## Multimodal messages

:::info
This feature is currently in preview. The message schema may change in future releases.
:::

OpenAI supports interleaving images with text in input messages with their `gpt-4-vision-preview`. Here's an example of how this looks:

import OpenAIVision from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_vision.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAIVision}</CodeBlock>

## Tool calling

:::info
This feature is currently only available for `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` and `gpt-4-1106-preview` models.
:::

More recent OpenAI chat models support calling multiple functions to get all required data to answer a question.
Here's an example how a conversation turn with this functionality might look:

import OpenAITools from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_tool_calls.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAITools}</CodeBlock>

## Custom URLs

You can customize the base URL the SDK sends requests to by passing a `configuration` parameter like this:

import OpenAICustomBase from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_custom_base.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAICustomBase}</CodeBlock>

You can also pass other `ClientOptions` parameters accepted by the official SDK.

If you are hosting on Azure OpenAI, see the [dedicated page instead](/docs/integrations/chat/azure).

## Calling fine-tuned models

You can call fine-tuned OpenAI models by passing in your corresponding `modelName` parameter.

This generally takes the form of `ft:{OPENAI_MODEL_NAME}:{ORG_NAME}::{MODEL_ID}`. For example:

import OpenAIFineTuned from "@examples/models/chat/integration_openai_fine_tune.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{OpenAIFineTuned}</CodeBlock>
